Astro provides a custom package to quickly add an RSS feed to your website.

This official package generates a non-HTML document with information about all of your blog posts that can be read by **feed readers** like Feedly, The Old Reader, and more. This document is updated every time your site is rebuilt.

Individuals can subscribe to your feed in a feed reader, and receive a notification when you publish a new blog post on your site, making it a popular blog feature.

1. Quit the Astro development server and run the following command in the terminal to install Astro’s RSS package.
   
    ```bash
    pnpm add @astrojs/rss
    ```

2. Restart the dev server to begin working on your Astro project again.

    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```
