## Overview

Vercel's Edge Functions empower you to deliver dynamic, personalized content using the lightweight Edge Runtime. Whether you're building web or React Native mobile applications, Edge Functions provide a responsive and performant solution. The Edge Runtime ensures global deployment, executing functions in the region nearest to the user, eliminating cold boot times.

**Key Features:**
- Low latency playback with WebRTC for livestreams and MP4 renditions for assets.
- Automatic fallback to HLS playback using HLS.js for uninterrupted viewing.
- Custom retry logic for handling livestream interruptions or transient network issues.

## Getting Started

### Nuxt on the Edge

Leverage Vue-based SSR on the edge with Nuxt 3, Nitro, and Vercel Edge Functions.

## How Edge Functions Work

Edge Functions utilize Vercel's Edge Runtime, built on the high-performance V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine. This allows functions to run in isolated environments without containers or virtual machines, ensuring lightweight and efficient execution. The global deployment on Vercel's Edge Network enables low-latency responses and eliminates cold boot times.

## Why Use Edge Functions

### Benefits

1. **Reduced Network Usage Costs:**
   - Execute near users or databases, minimizing network travel and reducing costs.

2. **Reduced Latency:**
   - Configure functions to execute near users for significantly lower latency compared to Serverless Functions.

3. **Personalized Dynamic Content:**
   - Deliver content based on the user's accessing region for a tailored experience.

4. **Support for Other Languages:**
   - Compile libraries in languages like C or Rust and use them in Edge Functions.

5. **Regional Edge Function Invocation:**
   - Configure functions to execute in specific regions for optimized performance.

### Using a Database with Edge Functions

- Optimize response times by limiting Edge Functions to regions near database dependencies or using globally-distributed databases like Edge Config, Vercel KV, and Vercel Blob.

### Limitations

- Max initial response time: 25 seconds
- Max post-compression size: 4 MB
- Considerations for data source distance and latency
- Limited support for native Node.js APIs

For a detailed comparison with Serverless Functions and additional limitations, refer to the documentation.

## Key Takeaways

- Edge Functions run post-Edge Network cache, supporting caching and real-time streaming.
- Utilize the Edge Runtime for faster cold boots but note the restriction on using Node.js APIs.
- Edge Functions have the same signature as Edge Middleware.
- Log and monitor Edge Functions through the console API and the Logs tab in the Vercel dashboard.

For further details and comparisons, explore the documentation.

### Comparison with Serverless Functions

Edge Functions offer advantages over Serverless Functions for globally distributed user bases. The following table summarizes key distinctions:

| Feature                    | Edge Functions                   | Serverless Functions              |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Deployment Region**       | Globally distributed              | Region-specific                   |
| **Network Usage**           | Reduced costs, shorter distances  | Potentially higher costs, longer distances  |
| **Latency**                 | Configurable for low latency      | Potentially higher latency        |
| **Dynamic Content**         | Personalized based on user region | Limited personalization          |
| **Language Support**        | Support for various languages     | Typically JavaScript/Node.js     |

### Logging

Edge Functions fully support the console API, including functions like `time`, `debug`, and `timeEnd`. Runtime logs can be accessed in the Vercel dashboard under the Logs tab, where you can filter and view Edge Function logs specifically.

### Additional Considerations

- **Limitations Overview:** Review the [Edge Functions limitations page](#link-to-limitations) for detailed information on constraints.
  
- **Code Organization:** Organize your Edge Functions effectively, considering the lightweight nature of the Edge Runtime.

### Conclusion

Vercel's Edge Functions provide a powerful and flexible solution for delivering dynamic content with low latency globally. Whether you are optimizing costs, reducing latency, or providing personalized experiences, Edge Functions offer a versatile and efficient toolset.

## Advanced Usage and Tips

### Customizing Edge Functions

When implementing Edge Functions, you can make use of the `@vercel/edge` package, which provides helpful functions like `geolocation` and `ipAddress`. These utilities enable you to add custom logic based on user location or IP address, enhancing the functionality of your Edge Functions.

### Feature Flags at the Edge

Optimize your application's performance by enabling or disabling feature flags at the edge. With Edge Config, you can dynamically control feature flags based on the region an Edge Function executes in, resulting in faster responses and improved user experiences.

### Using Next.js with Edge Functions

For those using Edge Functions with Next.js, you can import and leverage the `next/server` helpers (such as `NextRequest` and `NextResponse`). While not mandatory, these helpers can enhance your development workflow, especially when configuring API Routes to run at the edge.

### Monitoring and Debugging

Monitor the performance of your Edge Functions through the Vercel dashboard. The Logs tab provides detailed runtime logs for each function, aiding in debugging and optimization. Leverage the console API within your functions to incorporate custom logging for further insights.

### Continuous Optimization

Regularly review and optimize your Edge Functions to ensure they align with evolving application requirements. Considerations such as response times, data source proximity, and overall efficiency play crucial roles in maintaining optimal performance.
