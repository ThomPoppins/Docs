- Built-in CI/CD
- [Automatic HTTPS/SSL](/docs/security/encryption)
- [Previews](/docs/deployments/preview-deployments) for every git push
- 500,000 [Edge Functions](/docs/functions/edge-functions) execution units
- 1 million [Edge Middleware](/docs/functions/edge-middleware) invocations
- 10-second [Serverless Function](/docs/functions/serverless-functions) maximum duration
- 100 GB-hours of Serverless Function Execution

- 1 Concurrent Build
- 1,000 source images for [Image Optimization](/docs/image-optimization)

## Hobby Billing Cycle
As the Hobby plan is a free tier there are no billing cycles. However, in most cases, if you exceed your usage limits on the Hobby plan, you will have to wait until 30 days have passed before you can use the feature again.

Some features have shorter or longer time periods:

- [Web Analytics](/docs/analytics/limits-and-pricing#hobby)

As stated in the [fair use guidelines](/docs/limits/fair-use-guidelines#commercial-usage), users on the Hobby plan are restricted to non-commercial, personal use only.
