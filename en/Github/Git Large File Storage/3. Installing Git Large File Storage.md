In order to use Git LFS, you'll need to download and install a new program that's separate from Git.

## Platform navigation

- [Mac](?platform=mac)
- [Windows](?platform=windows)
- [Linux](?platform=linux)

### For Mac and Linux
1. Navigate to [git-lfs.com](https://git-lfs.com) and click **Download**. Alternatively, you can install Git LFS using a package manager:
   - To use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), run `brew install git-lfs`.
   - To use [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/), run `port install git-lfs`.
   If you install Git LFS with Homebrew or MacPorts, skip to step six.
2. On your computer, locate and unzip the downloaded file.
3. Open Terminal.
4. Change the current working directory into the folder you downloaded and unzipped:
   ```shell
   cd ~/Downloads/git-lfs-1.X.X
   ```
5. To install the file, run this command:
   ```shell
   ./install.sh
   ```
   Note: You may have to use `sudo ./install.sh` to install the file.
6. Verify that the installation was successful:
   ```shell
   git lfs install
   ```
   If the installation was not successful, please contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com). Be sure to include the name of your operating system.

### For Windows
1. Navigate to [git-lfs.com](https://git-lfs.com) and click **Download**.
   Tip: For more information about alternative ways to install Git LFS for Windows, see this [Getting started guide](https://github.com/github/git-lfs#getting-started).
2. On your computer, locate the downloaded file.
3. Double click on the file called `git-lfs-windows-1.X.X.exe`, where 1.X.X is replaced with the Git LFS version you downloaded. When you open this file, Windows will run a setup wizard to install Git LFS.
4. Open Git Bash. As the setup wizard may have modified your system `PATH`, opening a new session will ensure Git can locate Git LFS.
5. Verify that the installation was successful:
   ```shell
   git lfs install
   ```
   If the installation was not successful, please contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com). Be sure to include the name of your operating system.
